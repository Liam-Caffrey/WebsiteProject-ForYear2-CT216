# WebsiteProject-ForYear2-CT216
https://cliffordle.web.app/


Major Project of Year 2.
This was a group Project between 2, (originally 5) people.
The server could go down as our firebase credits are limited.
Me and one other Classmate made a website which contained a guessing game. 
The code was orginally uploaded to his Github but is on private so is re-uploaded here.
Google firebase was used and played a large part in the project. 
The game is called "Cliffordle", Based on a GAA award.
The goal is to guess a player from our database, One had to be made specifically for our website due to the fact that the GAA's association couldn't make their player database public. However most information on players was public.
The user takes turns guessing players, and using feedback information ascertains the target players identity.
So if the user guesses a player who is smaller than the target player, they will be told the target player is taller, (this is done for in each guessing category).
While my Teammate/Classmate handled they guessing game and programmed its functionality, I made the login, create account and signout pages.
The Project had to have sign-in and sign-out funcitonality and it would have been expanded upon greatly had the 2 of us had more resources.
The Sign-in, Sign-out and create account pages where all apart of and used Firebase
